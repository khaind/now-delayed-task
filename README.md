# now-delayed-task
Serverless function at Zeit Now v2 currently does not support delayed task or cronjob.
This repo is forked originally from https://github.com/apollographql/federation-demo for a template graphql gateway, then implement delayed task by calling other serverless function. The delay task implementation is refered from http://yurigor.com/how-to-make-http-request-from-node-js-without-waiting-for-response/
